**Nucleotides** 
are the building blocks of DNA and RNA molecules making up Nucleic acid chains. Consist of:  
* Sugar – a pentose ring, with/without an OH group on 2’C (Ribose/Deoxyribose).
* Nitrogenous Base – either a pyrimidine = 6 in a ring (Thymine/Cytosine/Uracil in RNA) or a Purine (Adenine or Guanine) a 5 ring + 6 ring connected to C1’
* Phosphate Group – a PO₄⁻³ group connected to C5’
	Can either be a nucleotide (all three) or a nucleoside (without the phosphate group.

DNA DOUBLE HELIX
In a complete molecule, there are two strands of DNA that are complimentary and antiparallel to each other – one is in 5’-3’, the other is 3’-5’. They are connected to each other by Hydrogen bonds of their complementary bases: G-C, A-T.
* Periodic structure – repeating orderly sequences, refers to the DNAs sugar-phosphate hydrophilic backbone.
* A-periodic structure – it’s a varying structure due to the different sequences of nucleotides needed for encoding different gene products. Is hydrophobic
